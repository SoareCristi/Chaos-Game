# Chaos-Game

Developed a Web Application using R Shiny that illustrates the Chaos Game and R
Markdown for documenting the project

The application starts with one random point in a hexagonal plane and the algorithm
generates points by plotting them a given distance from the previous point towards a
random vertex
