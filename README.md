# Chaos-Game

Developed a Web Application using R Shiny that illustrates the Chaos Game and R
Markdown for documenting the project

The application starts with one random point in a hexagonal plane and the algorithm
generates points by plotting them a given distance from the previous point towards a
random vertex

More information about the project can be found [here](https://github.com/SoareCristi/Chaos-Game/blob/main/ProiectPsRaport.pdf)

  - install R Studio
  - in R Studio console:
      - install.packages("shiny")
      - install.packages("shinyBS")
  - file -> open project -> select the ProiectPs.Rproj file
